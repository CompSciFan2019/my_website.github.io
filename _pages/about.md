2020: 
Won overall **1st place** in both rounds of the **NeurIPS-20 Flatland Challenge**, a railway scheduling competition which was held in partnership with German and Swiss railway companies. We outperformed all other entries in both tracks, including all reinforcement learning entries. According to the organizers, there were more than 700 participants from 51 countries making more than 2,000 submissions, [here for the USC press release](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2021/03/making-the-virtual-trains-run-on-time-usc-team-world-champs-in-ai-challenge/).
